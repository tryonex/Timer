# Timer

This is a very simple timer program. You can configure a given time and the timer will run down. At the end it will be blinking red. The window will turn translucent and the borders disappear when you press F1.

Prerequisites: Java 6+ JRE and JDK installed. [(Oracle downloads)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html). Make sure that everything is working and your environment variables are set up by typing ```javac -version``` and ```java -version``` into console. 

To download, compile and start the program do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/tryonex/Timer.git
cd Timer
cd src
javac -cp . ./de/andi/timer/Main.java
java de.andi.timer.Main
```
